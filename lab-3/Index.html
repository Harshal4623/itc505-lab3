  <h1>ITC505 Lab 3: Serving a Custom Font</h1>

  <p>
    For this lab, I used a font that most computers will not already have.
    Because of that, the browser cannot just “guess” the font from the user’s computer.
    Instead, my website provides the font file to the browser, just like it provides images or other files.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here is the basic process. First, the browser requests this HTML page. Then it sees the link to my CSS file.
    Inside the CSS file, I used <code>@font-face</code> to define a custom font name and point to the font file
    stored in my <code>fonts</code> folder. After the browser reads that rule, it makes an extra request to my server
    to download the font file. Once the font downloads, the browser uses it to display the text on the page.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the font file cannot load for some reason, my CSS includes a backup font (Arial) so the page is still readable.
    But when it loads correctly, the text should look obviously different and “font-crazy.”

  <!-- Required footer (keep exactly as given in the lab instructions) -->
  <footer>
      <p>Last updated:
          <span id="lastModified"></span>
      </p>
  </footer>
  <script type="text/javascript">
       var x = document.lastModified;
       document.getElementById('lastModified').textContent = x;
  </script>
</body>
</html>
