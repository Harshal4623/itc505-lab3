<h1>Lab 3: Serving a Custom Font</h1>

<div class="content">
    <p>
        Web browsers usually display text using fonts that are already installed on a user’s computer.
        This can be limiting if a website needs a specific or unique style.
    </p>

    <p>
        To solve this, I served my own font directly from the web server using the CSS
        <strong>@font-face</strong> rule. This rule allows a webpage to define a custom font and
        tell the browser exactly where the font file is located.
    </p>

    <p>
        When this page loads, the browser first downloads the HTML file and then the CSS file.
        The CSS file points to the font file stored in the <em>fonts</em> folder.
        The browser then requests that font file just like it would request an image or stylesheet.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once the font is downloaded, the browser uses it to render the text on the page.
        Because this font is unusual and not commonly installed, it is very easy to see that
        the custom font has been loaded successfully.

<footer>
    <p>Last updated:
        <span id="lastModified"></span>
    </p>
</footer>

<script type="text/javascript">
    var x = document.lastModified;
    document.getElementById("lastModified").textContent = x;
</script>

</body>
